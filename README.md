# AIplaysflappybird
- This project was created as my final year project. 
- I wanted to make a game but for some twist and a fine touch of ai i made an algorithm play it.
- I used NEAT algorithm for the project.
- start from makinng the ui and actually learining about displacement and different physics concepts to apply on the game was an amazing 
learning curve for me 
### To better understand the project i encourage you to please go through the ppt presentation or the documentation.
